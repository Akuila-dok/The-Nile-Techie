By following naming conventions, removing unnecessary code, and writing clear functions, you can significantly improve the overall quality of your software.",
      paragraph2:
        "One key to clean code is adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). Each function or module should have one clear responsibility, which makes it easier to debug and enhance later. When your code does too many things at once, it becomes difficult to maintain and increases the chances of introducing bugs.",
      paragraph3:
        "Another important tip is to reduce code duplication. If you find yourself writing similar code in multiple places, it’s a good idea to refactor it into a reusable function or module. Not only does this keep your codebase concise, but it also makes future changes easier since you only need to modify the code in one place.",
